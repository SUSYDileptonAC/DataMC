Welcome to Data/MC plotting for Dilepton Edge analyis!

How to make plots:

	Two basic selections of plots are already prepared, for AN and PAS, create them using
	make AN or make PAS (takes time!)
	
	If you want to make your own plots:
		1. Use the list plots in defs.py to select the desired plots, define them if they are not yet defined
		
		
		2. Choose a plot type. Available at the moment: 
			- DataMC: Simple Data/MC comparison
			- DataMC2011: The same for 2011 Data & MC
			- DataMC201153X: Same as above but using 53X ReReco of 2011 Data
			- CompareReco2011: Plots comparing 53X and 42X Reco of 2011 Data
			- CompareReco2011SFvsOF: Plots comparing 53X and 42X Reco of 2011 Data SFvsOF
			- CompareTTbar: Plots comparing three different ttbar generators
			- SFvsOF: The red&blue plots comparing SFvsOF in Data&MC
			- SFvsOF2011: The red&blue plots comparing SFvsOF in Data&MC for 2011 Data
			- SFvsOFFlavourSeperated: The red&blue plots comparing EE vs MuMu vs OF
		
		3. Choose a selection. Available at the moment:
			- SignalInclusive
			- SignalBarrel
			- SignalForward
			- SignalHighMET
			- SignalHighMETBarrel
			- SignalHighMETForward
			- SignalLowMET
			- SignalLowMETFullEta
			- Control
			- ControlCentral
			- ControlForward
			- bTagControl
			- DrellYan
			- Zpeak
			Choosing something else will result in inclusive dilepton selection
		make the plot by typing: 
		make plotType Region=Selection	
		
		Plots will be made for SF and OF if appropriate and for the run selections definde in defs.py
